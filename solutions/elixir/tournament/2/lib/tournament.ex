  Given `input` lines representing two teams and whether the first of them won,
  lost, or reached a draw, separated by semicolons, calculate the statistics
  for each team's number of games played, won, drawn, lost, and total points
  for the season, and return a nicely-formatted string table.

  A win earns a team 3 points, a draw earns 1 point, and a loss earns nothing.

  Order the outcome by most total points for the season, and settle ties by
  listing the teams in alphabetical order.
